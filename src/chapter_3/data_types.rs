/// # Scalar types:
///
/// A scalar type represents a single value.
/// In Rust has a four scalar types:
/// [integers, floating-point, boolean, character]
///
/// ## Integer types:
/// An integer types is a number without fractional components.
/// We can use any of these variants to declare the type of an integer value.
/// -------------------------------
/// | Length  | Signed | Unsigned |
/// |---------|--------|----------|
/// | 8-bit   | i8     | u8       |
/// | 16-bit  | i16    | u16      |
/// | 32-bit  | i32    | u32      |
/// | 64-bit  | i64    | u64      |
/// | 128-bit | i128   | u128     |
/// | arch    | isize  | usize    |
/// -------------------------------
///
/// ## Floating-point (float) types:
/// In floating-point types has two primitive types,
/// which are numbers with decimal points.
/// Floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`.
///
/// ## Boolean types:
/// A Boolean type in Rust has two possible values: `true` and `false`.
/// Booleans are one byte in size. The Boolean type in Rust is specified using bool
///
/// ## Character type:
/// Rust's `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Value,
/// which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII
///
/// ! Note: that we specify char literals with single quotes,
/// as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes.

/// # Compound Types:
///
/// Compound types can group multiple values into one type.
/// Rust has two primitive compound types: [tuples, arrays]
///
/// ## Tuples:
/// A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values
/// with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length:
/// once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.
///
/// Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values
/// in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same. We can added optional type annotations.
///
/// ## Array:
/// Arrays are another way to store data, but unlike tuples,
/// all elements in arrays must be of the same type.
///
/// Arrays are useful when we want our data allocated on the stack rather than the heap,
/// or when we want to ensure we always have a fixed number of elements.
///
/// ! Note: Arrays are non-growing, that is, unlike other programming languages,
/// arrays in Rust are static, meaning that an array cannot be grown or extended.
